# Multi Label Image Classification Demo
A simple and functional demo website for my B.Tech final year project demo.

## Getting started.
You need to have `python3` and `pip3` in your system.

### Installing
- First clone the project
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/sdsubhajitdas/Final-Year-Project-Demo.git
  ```
- (Optional) If you like you can use virtualenv to create a private environment and then activate it.
- Installing the required packages.
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
### Usage
- Running the project is very simple. It is a simple flask application which is serving a tensorflow model already pretrained & included in the repository. <br>
  Run this command to start the local server.
  ```
  python run.py
  ```
  This should give a output like this.<br>
